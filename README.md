## Setup instructions

Before you can clone and setup a local instance of this project you'll need to setup an Appwrite backend and gain the nessesary credentials + have the correct database setup and permisisons configured.

### Setting up appwrite backend

1. Create a new appwrite project + app. Easiest way to get started is by heading to [appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io/)

2. Add a platform and set hostname registration

This can be done by going to `overview` -> `Add Platform` -> `Web App`.

3. Add a user

4. Add a database and a collection

Add the following attributes in your collection

<table>
    <tr>    
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Details</th>
    <tr>
    <tr>    
        <td>body</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>100 chars</td>
    <tr>
    <tr>    
        <td>completed</td>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td>Default to false</td>
    <tr>
</table>

5. Set collection perissions

This can be done under from your collection tab unde `settings` -> `permissions`.

Set permissions to `users` + `create`
